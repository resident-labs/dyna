"""Ends a run stranded behind a dead self-hosted pool.

Runs on a GitHub-hosted runner beside jobs bound for the pool. GitHub lets such a
job wait 24 hours for a runner, so a pool that dies after a run was routed to it
would hold that run's checks for a day.

Waiting is not enough to call a job stuck, because a run queued behind a busy pool
waits too. So once this run has work queued and no progress for STALL_MINUTES, it
looks at the pool's jobs across the repository, and cancels only when twice in a row
none of them is running or has just finished. That is a pool that is down, or one
that cannot start a runner. The run ends red, and a rerun can use GitHub-hosted
runners.
